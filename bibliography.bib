               a systematic analysis for the Global Burden of Disease Study

  abstract  = "BACKGROUND: Global development goals increasingly rely on
               country-specific estimates for benchmarking a nation's progress.
               To meet this need, the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and
               Risk Factors Study (GBD) 2016 estimated global, regional,
               national, and, for selected locations, subnational
               cause-specific mortality beginning in the year 1980. Here we
               report an update to that study, making use of newly available
               data and improved methods. GBD 2017 provides a comprehensive
               assessment of cause-specific mortality for 282 causes in 195
               countries and territories from 1980 to 2017. METHODS: The causes
               of death database is composed of vital registration (VR), verbal
               autopsy (VA), registry, survey, police, and surveillance data.
               GBD 2017 added ten VA studies, 127 country-years of VR data, 502
               cancer-registry country-years, and an additional surveillance
               country-year. Expansions of the GBD cause of death hierarchy
               resulted in 18 additional causes estimated for GBD 2017. Newly
               available data led to subnational estimates for five additional
               countries-Ethiopia, Iran, New Zealand, Norway, and Russia.
               Deaths assigned International Classification of Diseases (ICD)
               codes for non-specific, implausible, or intermediate causes of
               death were reassigned to underlying causes by redistribution
               algorithms that were incorporated into uncertainty estimation.
               We used statistical modelling tools developed for GBD, including
               the Cause of Death Ensemble model (CODEm), to generate cause
               fractions and cause-specific death rates for each location,
               year, age, and sex. Instead of using UN estimates as in previous
               versions, GBD 2017 independently estimated population size and
               fertility rate for all locations. Years of life lost (YLLs) were
               then calculated as the sum of each death multiplied by the
               standard life expectancy at each age. All rates reported here
               are age-standardised. FINDINGS: At the broadest grouping of
               causes of death (Level 1), non-communicable diseases (NCDs)
               comprised the greatest fraction of deaths, contributing to
               73·4\% (95\% uncertainty interval [UI] 72·5-74·1) of total
               deaths in 2017, while communicable, maternal, neonatal, and
               nutritional (CMNN) causes accounted for 18·6\% (17·9-19·6), and
               injuries 8·0\% (7·7-8·2). Total numbers of deaths from NCD
               causes increased from 2007 to 2017 by 22·7\% (21·5-23·9),
               representing an additional 7·61 million (7·20-8·01) deaths
               estimated in 2017 versus 2007. The death rate from NCDs
               decreased globally by 7·9\% (7·0-8·8). The number of deaths for
               CMNN causes decreased by 22·2\% (20·0-24·0) and the death rate
               by 31·8\% (30·1-33·3). Total deaths from injuries increased by
               2·3\% (0·5-4·0) between 2007 and 2017, and the death rate from
               injuries decreased by 13·7\% (12·2-15·1) to 57·9 deaths
               (55·9-59·2) per 100 000 in 2017. Deaths from substance use
               disorders also increased, rising from 284 000 deaths (268
               000-289 000) globally in 2007 to 352 000 (334 000-363 000) in
               2017. Between 2007 and 2017, total deaths from conflict and
               terrorism increased by 118·0\% (88·8-148·6). A greater reduction
               in total deaths and death rates was observed for some CMNN
               causes among children younger than 5 years than for older
               adults, such as a 36·4\% (32·2-40·6) reduction in deaths from
               lower respiratory infections for children younger than 5 years
               compared with a 33·6\% (31·2-36·1) increase in adults older than
               70 years. Globally, the number of deaths was greater for men
               than for women at most ages in 2017, except at ages older than
               85 years. Trends in global YLLs reflect an epidemiological
               transition, with decreases in total YLLs from enteric
               infections, respiratory infections and tuberculosis, and
               maternal and neonatal disorders between 1990 and 2017; these
               were generally greater in magnitude at the lowest levels of the
               Socio-demographic Index (SDI). At the same time, there were
               large increases in YLLs from neoplasms and cardiovascular
               diseases. YLL rates decreased across the five leading Level 2
               causes in all SDI quintiles. The leading causes of YLLs in
               1990-neonatal disorders, lower respiratory infections, and
               diarrhoeal diseases-were ranked second, fourth, and fifth, in
               2017. Meanwhile, estimated YLLs increased for ischaemic heart
               disease (ranked first in 2017) and stroke (ranked third), even
               though YLL rates decreased. Population growth contributed to
               increased total deaths across the 20 leading Level 2 causes of
               mortality between 2007 and 2017. Decreases in the cause-specific
               mortality rate reduced the effect of population growth for all
               but three causes: substance use disorders, neurological
               disorders, and skin and subcutaneous diseases. INTERPRETATION:
               Improvements in global health have been unevenly distributed
               among populations. Deaths due to injuries, substance use
               disorders, armed conflict and terrorism, neoplasms, and
               cardiovascular disease are expanding threats to global health.
               For causes of death such as lower respiratory and enteric
               infections, more rapid progress occurred for children than for
               the oldest adults, and there is continuing disparity in
               mortality rates by sex across age groups. Reductions in the
               death rate of some common diseases are themselves slowing or
               have ceased, primarily for NCDs, and the death rate for selected
               causes has increased in the past decade. FUNDING: Bill \&

               post-discharge socioeconomic and quality-of-life outcomes can
               help better understand and reduce the consequences of trauma.
               METHODS: We performed a scoping review to map the existing
               research on post-discharge outcomes for trauma patients,
               irrespective of the country or setting in which the study was
               performed. The scoping review was conducted by searching six
               databases - MEDLINE, EMBASE, the Cochrane Library, Global Index
               Medicus, BASE, and Web of Science - to identify all articles
               that report post-discharge socioeconomic or quality of life
               outcomes in trauma patients from 2009 to 2018. RESULTS: Seven
               hundred fifty-eight articles were included in this study,
               extracting 958 outcomes. Most studies (82\%) were from
               high-income countries (HICs). More studies from low- and
               middle-income countries (LMICs) were cross-sectional (71\%)
               compared with HIC settings (46\%). There was a wide variety of
               different definitions, interpretations, and measurements used by
               various articles for similar outcomes. Quality of life, return
               to work, social support, cost, and participation were the main
               outcomes studied in post-discharge trauma patients. CONCLUSIONS:
               The wide range of outcomes and outcome measures reported across
               different types of injuries and settings. This variability can
               be a barrier when comparing across different types of injuries
               and settings. Post-discharge trauma studies should move towards
               building evidence based on standardized measurement of outcomes.",

  abstract  = "BACKGROUND: Traumatic injuries represent a considerable public
               health burden with significant personal and societal costs. The
               care of the severely injured patient in a trauma system
               progresses along a continuum that includes numerous
               interventions being provided by a multidisciplinary group of
               healthcare personnel. Despite the recent emphasis on quality of
               care in medicine, there has been little research to direct
               trauma clinicians and administrators on how optimally to monitor
               and improve upon the quality of care delivered within a trauma
               system. Audit filters are one mechanism for improving quality of
               care and are defined as specific clinical processes or outcomes
               of care that, when they occur, represent unfavorable deviations
               from an established norm and which prompt review and feedback.
               Although audit filters are widely utilized for performance
               improvement in trauma systems they have not been subjected to
               systematic review of their effectiveness. OBJECTIVES: To
               determine the effectiveness of using audit filters for improving
               processes of care and clinical outcomes in trauma systems.
               SEARCH STRATEGY: Our search strategy included an electronic
               search of the Cochrane Injuries Group Specialized Register, the
               Cochrane EPOC Group Specialized Register, CENTRAL (The Cochrane
               Library 2008, Issue 4), MEDLINE, PubMed, EMBASE, CINAHL, and ISI
               Web of Science: (SCI-EXPANDED and CPCI-S). We handsearched the
               Journal of Trauma, Injury, Annals of Emergency Medicine,
               Academic Emergency Medicine, and Injury Prevention. We searched
               two clinical trial registries: 1) The World Health Organization
               International Clinical Trials Registry Platform and, 2) Clinical
               Trials.gov. We also contacted content experts for further
               articles. The most recent electronic search was completed in
               December 2008 and the handsearch was completed up to February
               2009. SELECTION CRITERIA: We searched for randomized controlled
               trials, controlled clinical trials, controlled before-and-after
               studies, and interrupted time series studies that used audit
               filters as an intervention for improving processes of care,
               morbidity, or mortality for severely injured patients. DATA
               COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two authors independently screened the
               search results, applied inclusion criteria, and extracted data.
               MAIN RESULTS: There were no studies identified that met the
               inclusion criteria for this review. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: We
               were unable to identify any studies of sufficient methodological
               quality to draw conclusions regarding the effectiveness of audit
               filters as a performance improvement intervention in trauma
               systems. Future research using rigorous study designs should
               focus on the relative effectiveness of audit filters in
               comparison to alternative quality improvement strategies at
               improving processes of care, functional outcomes, and mortality

  abstract  = "BACKGROUND: The Global Burden of Diseases (GBD), Injuries, and
               Risk Factors study used the disability-adjusted life year (DALY)
               to quantify the burden of diseases, injuries, and risk factors.
               This paper provides an overview of injury estimates from the
               2013 update of GBD, with detailed information on incidence,
               mortality, DALYs and rates of change from 1990 to 2013 for 26
               causes of injury, globally, by region and by country. METHODS:
               Injury mortality was estimated using the extensive GBD mortality
               database, corrections for ill-defined cause of death and the
               cause of death ensemble modelling tool. Morbidity estimation was
               based on inpatient and outpatient data sets, 26 cause-of-injury
               and 47 nature-of-injury categories, and seven follow-up studies
               with patient-reported long-term outcome measures. RESULTS: In
               2013, 973 million (uncertainty interval (UI) 942 to 993) people
               sustained injuries that warranted some type of healthcare and
               4.8 million (UI 4.5 to 5.1) people died from injuries. Between
               1990 and 2013 the global age-standardised injury DALY rate
               decreased by 31\% (UI 26\% to 35\%). The rate of decline in DALY
               rates was significant for 22 cause-of-injury categories,
               including all the major injuries. CONCLUSIONS: Injuries continue
               to be an important cause of morbidity and mortality in the
               developed and developing world. The decline in rates for almost
               all injuries is so prominent that it warrants a general
               statement that the world is becoming a safer place to live in.
               However, the patterns vary widely by cause, age, sex, region and

              trauma deaths contains many unstudied confounding factors. To
              investigate the reliability of methods for identifying such
              preventable deaths, we compared three consensus systems using
              separate five-member general review panels assessing 20
              non-central nervous system fatalities: panel A, independent
              judgments; panel B, discussion of all cases preceding individual
              judgments; and panel C, independent judgments followed by
              discussion and equivocal case reassignment. The Kappa concordance
              index was low for all methods (method A, 0.20; methods B and C,
              0.40). Of the 11 deaths judged preventable by at least one panel,
              only one death was judged preventable by all three panels.
              Consensus agreement (four of five assessors) was 20\% for panel
              A, 45\% for panel B, and 10\% for panel C (difference between
              panels B and C, p less than 0.03). In panel C, discussion
              affected the rate of equivocal case designation from 30\% to 5\%.
              Thus different consensus methods yielded different results. We
              conclude that individual case review can be severely flawed and

              patient care. We recommend that assessment of institutional
              performance should be based on objective evaluation methods,

               Prospective observational study. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This was
               a prospective observational study on two hundred elderly trauma
               patients who were admitted to JSS Hospital, Mysuru over a
               consecutive period of 18 months between December 2016 to May
               2018. On the day of admission, data were collected from each
               patient to compute the ISS, NISS, RTS, and TRISS. RESULTS: Mean
               age of patients was 66.35 years. Most common mechanism of injury
               was road traffic accident (94.0\%) with mortality of 17.0\%. The
               predictive accuracies of the ISS, NISS, RTS and the TRISS were
               compared using receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curves for
               the prediction of mortality. Best cutoff points for predicting
               mortality in elderly trauma patient using TRISS system was a
               score of 91.6 (sensitivity 97\%, specificity of 88\%, area under
               ROC curve 0.972), similarly cutoff point under the NISS was
               score of 17(91\%, 93\%, 0.970); for ISS best cutoff point was at
               15(91\%, 89\%, 0.963) and for RTS it was 7.108(97\%,80\%,0.947).
               There were statistical differences among ISS, NISS, RTS and
               TRISS in terms of area under the ROC curve (p <0.0001).
               CONCLUSION: TRISS was the strongest predictor of mortality in
               elderly trauma patients when compared to the ISS, NISS and RTS.

              identifying opportunities for improvement (OFI). The aim of this
              study was to assess how patient and process factors are
              associated with OFI in trauma care. METHODS: We conducted a
              registry-based study using all patients between 2017 and 2021
              from the Karolinska University Hospital who had been reviewed
              regarding the presence of OFI as defined by a morbidity and
              mortality conference. We used bi- and multivariable logistic
              regression to assess the associations between the following
              patient and process factors and OFI: age, sex, respiratory rate,
              systolic blood pressure, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS), Injury
              Severity Score (ISS), survival at 30 days, highest hospital care

              associated with OFI, indicating that patients with moderate to
              severe trauma and those with delays to first CT are at the

  abstract = "Trauma is a significant public health issue worldwide,
              particularly affecting economically active age groups. Quality
              management of trauma care at the national level is crucial to
              improve outcomes of major trauma. In Korea, a biennial nationwide
              survey on preventable trauma death rate is conducted. Based on
              the survey results, we analyzed opportunities for improving the
              trauma treatment process. Expert panels reviewed records of 8282
              and 8482 trauma-related deaths in 2017 and 2019, respectively,
              identifying 258 and 160 cases in each year as preventable deaths.
              Opportunities for improvement were categorized into prehospital,

              cause of death, followed by sepsis/multiorgan failure and central
              nervous system injury. Delayed hemostatic procedures and
              transfusions were common areas for improvement in hospital stage.
              Interhospital transfers experienced significant delays in arrival

               opportunities for performance improvement (OPIs) identified in
               patients who died from bleeding and were considered by the
               quality improvement system of a major trauma centre. METHODS:
               All trauma deaths in 2006-2010 were discussed at the trauma
               morbidity and mortality meeting. Deaths from haemorrhage were
               identified and subjected to qualitative and quantitative
               evaluation. OPIs were identified and remedial action was taken.
               RESULTS: During the study interval there were 7511 trauma team
               activations; 423 patients died. Haemorrhage was the second most
               common cause of death, in 112 patients, and made a substantial
               contribution to death in a further 15. For 84 of these 127
               patients, a total of 150 OPIs were identified. Most arose in the
               emergency department, but involved personnel from many
               departments. Problems with decision-making were more common than
               errors in technical skill. OPIs frequently involved the decision
               between surgery, radiology and further investigation. Delayed
               and inappropriate surgery occurred even when investigation and
               diagnosis were appropriate. The mortality rate among patients
               presenting in shock fell significantly over the study interval
               (P < 0·026). CONCLUSION: Problems with judgement are more common
               than those of skill. Death from traumatic haemorrhage is
               associated with identifiable, remediable failures in care. The
               implementation of a systematic trauma quality improvement system

               conducted at a single institution from July 2016 to November
               2019. SETTING: Surgical and Trauma ICU at a single urban
               academic quaternary care center. PATIENTS: All patients admitted
               to the surgical and trauma ICU between July 2016 and November
               2019 were eligible for the study as all ICU beds in our health
               system institutions are equipped with closed circuit video/audio
               monitoring. Through an institutional review board approved
               program, any event triggering the immediate bedside presence of
               a provider in the ICU is routinely recorded at the discretion of
               the care team or tele-intensivist. INTERVENTIONS: A database of
               these events was created over a 3-year period, and cases were
               reviewed for content, quality improvement, and educational
               opportunities. Select recordings were analyzed and shared at
               multidisciplinary/multiprofessional video review sessions.
               MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: There were 286 critical events
               video recorded and reviewed in the ICUs between July 2016 and
               November 2019. The most commonly recorded events included:
               cardiopulmonary arrests (n = 75), intubations (n = 71), and
               acute clinical decompensation triggered by nonreassuring vital
               signs (n = 57) or arrhythmias (n = 13). Of these recordings, 59
               were shared at video review conferences, where quality of care
               was assessed and thematic opportunities for improvement were
               characterized. Recurrent quality improvement themes that were
               identified included adherence to protocols, the importance of
               teamwork and closed-loop communication, clearly designated team
               leadership, and the use of universal precautions. CONCLUSIONS:
               Video review in the ICU is feasible and presents valuable
               opportunities for quality improvement and educational

               with otherwise survivable injuries account for up to 10\% of
               fatalities in Level I trauma centers, 50\% of these errors occur
               in the intensive care unit (ICU). The root cause of 67\% of the
               Joint Commission sentinel events is communication errors. The
               objective is (1) to study how critical information degrades and
               how it is lost over 24 hours and (2) to determine whether a
               structured checklist for ICU handoffs prevents information loss.
               METHODS: Prospective cohort study of trauma and surgical ICU
               teams observed with and without use of the checklist. An
               observational period (control group) was followed by a didactic
               session on the science and use of a checklist (study group),
               which was used for patient management and handoffs. Information
               was tracked for a 24-hour period and all handoffs. Comparisons
               use chi or Fisher's exact test and a p value <0.05 was defined
               as significant. RESULTS: Three hundred and thirty-two patient
               ICU days were observed (119 control, 213 study) and 689 patient
               care items (303 control, 386 study) were followed. Seventy-five
               (10.9\%) items were lost over 24 hours; 61 of 303 (20.1\%)
               without checklist and 14 of 386 (3.6\%) with checklist (p <
               0.0001). Critical laboratory values and test results were the
               most frequent lost items (36.1\% control vs. 4.5\% study p <
               0.0001). Six of 75 (8.1\%) items were correctly ordered but not
               carried out by ICU nursing staff--all caught and corrected with
               checklist use. CONCLUSION: Critical information is degraded over
               24 hours in the ICU. A structured checklist significantly
               reduces patient errors due to lost information and communication
               lapses between trauma ICU team members at handoffs of care.",

               suggests high in-hospital survivability. However, little is
               known about their long-term outcomes, especially in the context
               of a prolonged ICU length-of-stay (LOS). We sought to determine
               the association between prolonged ICU-LOS and 1-year survival in
               trauma patients. METHODS: TRICARE claims data (2011-2015) were
               queried for trauma patients with an Injury Severity Score > 9.
               Risk-adjusted Cox models were used to determine the influence of
               prolonged ICU LOS on 1-year mortality. RESULTS: Of 19,155
               patients included, 40\% were admitted to the ICU. The overall
               1-year mortality was 3.9\% and 4.7\% in patients with ICU LOS >9
               days. In the multivariable model older age (55-64 vs. 18-24
               years) (HR: 47.8, CI:20.8-109.9), prior comorbidities (>1 vs. 0)
               (HR: 2.6, CI: 2.1-3.2), discharge disposition (transfer vs
               discharge) (HR: 2.3 CI: 1.7-3.1) and ICU-LOS (>7 vs. 1 days)
               (HR:2.6, CI:1.7-4.0) were associated with 1-year mortality.
               CONCLUSION: Prolonged ICU-LOS is a risk factor for 1-year
               mortality in trauma patients. But an overall high survival
               (>96\%) reinforces the justification for such use of the ICU in
               trauma patients when clinically necessary.",

               is known about factors involved in its progression,
               complications and cause of death. We aimed to identify such
               factors and the time when the original illness was no longer the
               reason for intensive care unit (ICU) stay. DESIGN: Retrospective
               matched case-control study using an accepted PerCI definition (>
               10 days in ICU). SETTING: Single-centre tertiary metropolitan
               ICU. PARTICIPANTS: All adult patients admitted during a 2-year
               period were eligible, matched on diagnostic code, gender, age
               and risk of death. MAIN RESULTS: Seventy-two patients staying >
               10 days (PerCI cases) were matched to 72 control patients. The
               original illness was no longer a cause for continued ICU stay
               after a median of 10 days (interquartile range [IQR], 7-16)
               versus 2 days (IQR, 0-3); P < 0.001. Patients with PerCI were
               more likely to develop new sepsis (52.8\% v 23.6\%; P < 0.001),
               delirium (37.5\% v 9.7\%; P < 0.001), ICU-acquired weakness
               (15.3\% v 0\%, P = 0.001), and to be discharged to chronic care
               or rehabilitation (37.5\% v 16.7\%; P < 0.005). Death resulting
               from sepsis with multi-organ failure occurred in 16.7\% v 8.3\%
               of control patients (P = 0.13), and one-third of patients with
               PerCI were not mechanically ventilated on Day 10. CONCLUSION:
               PerCI likely results from complications acquired after ICU
               admission and mostly unrelated to the original illness; by Day
               10, the original illness does not appear to be its cause, and
               new sepsis appears an important association.",

               (<8 days) and prolonged ($\geq$8 days) intensive care unit (ICU)
               stay. METHODS: Former EPaNIC-trial patients were included in
               this preplanned prospective cohort, 5-year follow-up study.
               Mortality was assessed in all. For morbidity analyses, all
               long-stay and-for feasibility-a random sample (30\%) of
               short-stay survivors were contacted. Primary outcomes were total
               and post-28-day 5-year mortality. Secondary outcomes comprised
               handgrip strength (HGF, \%pred), 6-minute-walking distance
               (6MWD, \%pred) and SF-36 Physical Function score (PF SF-36).
               One-to-one propensity-score matching of short-stay and long-stay
               patients was performed for nutritional strategy, demographics,
               comorbidities, illness severity and admission diagnosis.
               Multivariable regression analyses were performed to explore ICU
               factors possibly explaining any post-ICU observed outcome
               differences. RESULTS: After matching, total and post-28-day
               5-year mortality were higher for long-stayers (48.2\% (95\%CI:
               43.9\% to 52.6\%) and 40.8\% (95\%CI: 36.4\% to 45.1\%)) versus
               short-stayers (36.2\% (95\%CI: 32.4\% to 40.0\%) and 29.7\%
               (95\%CI: 26.0\% to 33.5\%), p<0.001). ICU risk factors comprised
               hypoglycaemia, use of corticosteroids, neuromuscular blocking
               agents, benzodiazepines, mechanical ventilation, new dialysis
               and the occurrence of new infection, whereas clonidine could be
               protective. Among 276 long-stay and 398 short-stay 5-year
               survivors, HGF, 6MWD and PF SF-36 were significantly lower in
               long-stayers (matched subset HGF: 83\% (95\%CI: 60\% to 100\%)
               versus 87\% (95\%CI: 73\% to 103\%), p=0.020; 6MWD: 85\%
               (95\%CI: 69\% to 101\%) versus 94\% (95\%CI: 76\% to 105\%),
               p=0.005; PF SF-36: 65 (95\%CI: 35 to 90) versus 75 (95\%CI: 55

               is associated with excess 5-year mortality and morbidity,

              length of stay (ICU-LOS). However, as patients can show
              significant heterogeneity in response to a treatment, there might
              exists subgroups with differential effects. The existence and

              a classification model for risks prediction and a regression

               to an intensive care unit (ICU) based on their illness severity
               coupled with their co-morbidities. Patient attributes such as

               patient gender with admission to the ICU amongst hospital
               physicians working in Sweden. METHODS: Primary outcome assessed
               was gender bias among respondents. Two different versions of an
               online survey, with eight patient cases, were sent to physicians
               in Sweden who within their field of specialty meet patients that
               could be eligible for intensive care. The versions of the survey
               were identical except that the patient gender in each case was
               exchanged between the two surveys. Depending on the respondent's
               birthday (odd or even number) they were directed to one of the
               two surveys. At the end of each case the respondent was asked to
               answer if they thought that the patient needed ICU care, yes or
               no. The respondents were not told in advance about the design of
               the survey. The respondents were also asked to state their age,
               sex, field of specialty, size of hospital and title. RESULTS: Of
               1426 respondents, 679 and 747 answered survey 1 and 2,
               respectively. Overall, there were no significant differences in
               willingness to admit in between cases describing a man or woman
               in the physician responses. DISCUSSION: Anesthesiology/intensive
               care physicians more often choose to admit patients to the ICU
               compared to all other specialties. Female physicians tended to
               be more willing to admit patients, regardless of patient gender,
               than their male counterparts. CONCLUSIONS: Using a survey, with
               eight cases differing only with regards to the gender of the

               patients, especially in premenopausal women. Previous clinical
               studies have shown contradictory results regarding protective
               effects of gender on outcome after severe trauma. The objective
               of this study was to determine the association between gender
               and outcome (mortality and Intensive Care Unit (ICU) admission)
               among severely injured patients in the Netherlands. METHODS: A
               retrospective multicentre study was performed including all
               polytrauma patients (Injury Severity Score (ISS) $\geq$16)
               admitted to the ED of three level 1 trauma centres, between
               January 1st, 2006 and December 31st, 2014. Data on age, gender,
               mechanism of injury, ISS, Abbreviated Injury Scale (AIS),
               prehospital intubation, Revised Trauma Score (RTS), systolic
               blood pressure (SBP) and Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) upon admission
               at the Emergency Department was collected from three Regional
               Trauma Registries. To determine whether gender was an
               independent predictor of mortality and ICU admission, logistic
               regression analysis was performed. RESULTS: Among 6865 trauma
               patients, male patients had a significantly higher ISS compared
               to female patients (26.3 $\pm$ 10.2 vs 25.3 $\pm$ 9.7, P = <
               0.0001). Blunt trauma was significantly more common in the
               female group (95.2\% vs 92.3\%, P = < 0.0001). Males aged 16- to
               44-years had a significant higher in-hospital mortality rate
               (10.4\% vs 13.4\%, P = 0.046). ICU admission rate was
               significantly lower in females (49.3\% vs 54.5\%, P = < 0.0001).
               In the overall group, logistic regression did not show gender as
               an independent predictor for in-hospital mortality (OR 1.020
               (95\% CI 0.865-1.204), P = 0.811) or mortality within 24 h (OR
               1.049 (95\% CI 0.829-1.327), P = 0.693). However, male gender
               was associated with an increased likelihood for ICU admission in
               the overall group (OR 1.205 (95\% CI 1.046-1.388), P = 0.010).
               CONCLUSION: The current study shows that in this population of
               severely injured patients, female sex is associated with a lower
               in-hospital mortality rate among those aged 16- to 44-years.
               Furthermore, female sex is independently associated with an
               overall decreased likelihood for ICU admission. More research is

               hospital mortality. We compared the lengths of ICU stay and the
               intensity of care of men and women. RESULTS: Male gender was
               associated with increased hospital mortality among postoperative
               ICU patients [adjusted odds ratio 1.33 (95\% confidence interval
               1.12-1.58, P = 0.001)] but not among medical patients [adjusted
               odds ratio 1.02 (95\% confidence interval 0.92-1.13, P = 0.74)].
               Male gender was associated with an increased risk of death
               particularly in the oldest age group (75 years or older) and
               among the patients with relatively low APACHE II scores (<16).
               Mean length of ICU stay was 3.2 days for men and 2.6 days for
               women (P < 0.001). Male patients comprised 61.7\% of the study
               population but consumed 66.0\% of days in intensive care.
               CONCLUSION: Male gender contributes to poor outcome in
               postoperative ICU patients. Approximately two-thirds of ICU
               resources are consumed by male patients.",

               determined by the injury per se and inherent properties of the
               organism at the time of injury. We analyzed whether pre-injury
               morbidity scored on a four-level ordinal scale according to the
               American Society of Anesthesiologists Physical Status (ASA-PS)
               classification system predicts mortality after trauma.
               MATERIALS: From a total of 3,773 prospectively collected
               patients (years 2000-2004), 3,728 patients were included. Main
               outcome measure was mortality 30 days after injury. The effect
               of pre-injury ASA-PS on mortality was assessed using linear
               logistic regression analysis, controlling for Revised Trauma
               Score (RTS), Injury Severity Score (ISS), and age. RESULTS:
               Mortality increased with increasing pre-injury ASA-PS, age, and
               ISS, and with decreasing RTS. Unadjusted mortality rates were
               5.7\% in ASA-PS 1, 12.3\% in ASA-PS 2, and 26.4\% in ASA-PS 3-4.
               This increasing mortality trend across pre-injury ASA-PS group
               was evident in nearly all categories of ISS, RTS, and age. Odds
               ratio for death was 1.76 (95\% CI, 1.14-2.72) for pre-injury
               ASA-PS 2, and 2.25 (95\% CI, 1.36-3.71) for ASA-PS 3-4 compared
               with for ASA-PS 1 and adjusted for ISS, RTS, and age. There were
               no interaction effects between pre-injury ASA-PS and the other
               variables. CONCLUSIONS: Pre-injury ASA-PS score was an
               independent predictor of mortality after trauma, also after
               adjusting for the major variables in the traditional TRISS
               (Trauma and Injury Severity Score) formula. Including pre-injury

               Template for Uniform Reporting of Data. Little is known about
               the reliability of pre-injury ASA-PS scores. The objective of
               this study was to examine whether the pre-injury ASA-PS system
               was a reliable scale for grading comorbidity in trauma patients.
               METHODS: Nineteen Norwegian trauma registry coders were invited
               to participate in a reliability study in which 50 real but
               anonymised patient medical records were distributed. Reliability
               was analysed using quadratic weighted kappa ($\kappa$(w))
               analysis with 95\% CI as the primary outcome measure and
               unweighted kappa ($\kappa$) analysis, which included unknown
               values, as a secondary outcome measure. RESULTS: Fifteen of the
               invitees responded to the invitation, and ten participated. We
               found moderate ($\kappa$(w)=0.77 [95\% CI: 0.64-0.87]) to

               The inter-rater reliability ranged from moderate
               ($\kappa$(w)=0.66 [95\% CI: 0.45-0.81]) to substantial
               ($\kappa$(w)=0.96 [95\% CI: 0.88-1.00]) for $\kappa$(w) and from

  abstract  = "On-call working time arrangements are increasingly common,
               involve work only in the event of an unpredictable incident and
               exist primarily outside of standard hours. Like other
               non-standard working time arrangements, on-call work disrupts
               sleep and can therefore have negative effects on health, safety
               and performance. Unlike other non-standard working time
               arrangements, on-call work often allows sleep opportunities
               between calls. Any sleep obtained during on-call periods will be
               beneficial for waking performance. However, there is evidence
               that sleep while on call may be of substantially reduced
               restorative value because of the expectation of receiving the
               call and apprehension about missing the call. In turn, waking
               from sleep to respond to a call may be associated with temporary
               increases in performance impairment. This is dependent on
               characteristics of both the preceding sleep, the tasks required
               upon waking and the availability and utility of any
               countermeasures to support the transition from sleep to wake. In
               this paper, we critically evaluate the evidence both for and
               against sleeping during on-call periods and conclude that some
               sleep, even if it is of reduced quality and broken by repeated
               calls, is a good strategy. We also note, however, that
               organisations utilising on-call working time arrangements need
               to systematically manage the likelihood that on-call sleep can
               be associated with temporary performance impairments upon
               waking. Given that the majority of work in this area has been
               laboratory-based, there is a significant need for field-based
               investigations of the magnitude of sleep inertia, in addition to
               the utility of sleep inertia countermeasures. Field studies
               should include working with subject matter experts to identify
               the real-world impacts of changes in performance associated with
               sleeping, or not sleeping, whilst on call.",

               admitted to intensive care unit (ICU), and to elaborate mixed
               statistical models to improve the precision of the scores.
               METHODS: A prospective study of cohorts. The combined
               medical/surgical ICU in a secondary university hospital. Seven
               hundred and eighty trauma patients admitted to ICU older than 16
               years of age. Anatomic models (ISS and NISS) were compared and
               combined with physiological models (T-RTS, APACHE II [APII], and
               MPM II). The probability of death was calculated following the
               TRISS method. The discrimination was assessed using ROC curves
               (ABC [CI 95\%]), and the calibration using the Hosmer-Lemeshoẃs
               H test. The mixed models were elaborated with the tree
               classification method type Chi Square Automatic Interaction
               Detection. RESULTS: A 14\% global mortality was recorded. The
               physiological models presented the best discrimination values
               (APII of 0.87 [0.84-0.90]). All models were affected by bad
               calibration (P<.01). The best mixed model resulted from the
               combination of APII and ISS (0.88 [0.83-0.90]). This model was
               able to differentiate between a 7.5\% mortality for elderly
               patients with pathological antecedents and a 25\% mortality in
               patients presenting traumatic brain injury, from a pool of
               patients with APII values ranging from 10 to 17 and an ISS
               threshold of 22. CONCLUSIONS: The physiological models perform
               better than the anatomical models in traumatic patients admitted
               to the ICU. Patients with low scores in the physiological models
               require an anatomic analysis of the injuries to determine their

               However, which scoring system is better in trauma outcome
               prediction is still disputed. The purpose of this study is to
               evaluate the value of the two scoring systems in predicting
               trauma outcomes, including mortality, intensive care unit (ICU)
               admission and ICU length of stay. METHODS: The data were
               collected retrospectively from three hospitals in Zhejiang
               province, China. The comparisons of NISS and ISS in predicting
               outcomes were performed by using receiver operator
               characteristic (ROC) curves and Hosmer-Lemeshow statistics.
               RESULTS: A total of 1825 blunt trauma patients were enrolled in
               our study. Finally, 1243 patients were admitted to ICU, and 215
               patients died before discharge. The ISS and NISS were equivalent
               in predicting mortality (area under ORC curve [AUC]: 0.886 vs.
               0.887, p = 0.9113). But for the patients with ISS $\geq$25, NISS
               showed better performance in predicting mortality. NISS was also
               significantly better than ISS in predicting ICU admission and
               prolonged ICU length of stay. CONCLUSION: NISS outperforms ISS
               in predicting the outcomes for severe blunt trauma and can be an
               essential supplement of ISS. Considering the convenience of NISS

              the quality of trauma care and is used to identify and address
              opportunities for improvement based on reviewing patient cases.
              Current systems rely on audit filters for review selection, a
              process that is hampered by high frequencies of false
              positives.1.2ObjectivesTo develop, validate, and compare the
              performance of different machine learning models for predicting
              opportunities for improvement.1.3MethodsWe conducted a registry
              based study using all patients from the Karolinska university
              hospital that had been reviewed regarding the presence of
              opportunity for improvement, a binary consensus decision from the
              mortality and morbidity conference. We developed eight binary
              classification models using 45 predictors. Training used an
              80\%-20\% train-test split and 1000 resamples without replacement
              estimated confidence intervals. Performance (sensitivity,
              specificity, integrated calibration index, Area under the
              receiver operating characteristics curve) was also compared to
              current audit filters.1.4Measurements and Main ResultsThe dataset
              included 6310 patients where opportunities for improvement were
              present among 431 (7\%) patients. The audit filters (Area under
              the receiver operating characteristics curve: 0.624) was
              outperformed by all machine learning models. The best performing
              model was LightGBM (Area under the receiver operating
              characteristics curve: 0.789).1.5ConclusionsMachine learning
              models outperform the currently used audit filters and could
              prove to be valuable additions in the screening for opportunities
              for improvement. More research is needed on how to increase model
              performance and how to incorporate these models into trauma

               management of orthopaedic fractures using the National Surgical
               Quality Improvement Program (NSQIP) database. METHODS: We
               analyzed all patients with orthopaedic trauma injuries in the
               American College of Surgeons NSQIP database from 2005 to 2011. A
               total of 8761 patients representing 91 orthopaedic trauma
               procedures were identified and included in analysis after
               selection. Logistic regressions were conducted to identify the
               predictive ability of ASA on the likelihood of readmission for
               patients in each anatomic category (upper extremity,
               pelvis/acetabulum, lower extremity) and the combined study
               population. RESULTS: The ASA physical status proved the
               strongest predictor of 30-day readmission for the selected
               orthopaedic trauma procedures. After controlling for age,
               gender, race, and medical comorbidities that were shown to be
               significant independent risk factors for readmission, ASA score
               continued to have a significant association on 30-day

               confidence interval = 1.13-1.88, P = 0.001). For the combined
               analysis, compared with patients with an ASA score of 1,
               patients with an ASA score of 2 were 1.04 times as likely to

               that ASA classification is a universally collected data point,
               this method can be used in almost any hospital system and for
               any operative service. This model may be used to more accurately
               predict a patient's postoperative course and the expected risk
               for readmission, such that hospitals can target these
               ``at-risk'' individuals and reduce 30-day readmissions. LEVEL OF

               patients with hip fractures. DESIGN: Retrospective chart review.
               SETTING: All patients who presented to a large tertiary care
               center between January 2000 and December 31, 2009. PARTICIPANTS:
               Charts for all patients older than 60 years who presented with
               isolated low-energy hip fractures were reviewed. Of the 719
               patients identified, 660 were included. INTERVENTION: Patients
               who underwent operative fixation or hemiarthroplasty secondary
               to hip fracture were identified using a search of Current
               Procedural Terminology (CPT) codes search. MAIN OUTCOME
               MEASUREMENTS: Gender, height, weight, body mass index, length of
               procedure, American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA)
               classification, and medical comorbidities were gathered and
               compared with LOS and direct daily inpatient hospital cost.
               RESULTS: No correlation existed between body mass index or
               specific comorbidities and LOS, but ASA classification was a
               predictor. For each ASA increase of 1, average LOS increased
               2.053 days (P < 0.001). Given total daily cost to the hospital
               for these patients was $4530, each increase in ASA
               classification translated to an increase of $9300. CONCLUSIONS:
               ASA classification proved useful in estimating LOS and cost for
               patients undergoing operative fixation of hip fractures. Because
               ASA classification and cost are universally collected, this
               method can be employed in almost any hospital. This highlights a
               role for ASA classification in preoperative estimation of the
               elderly patient's cost and a potential advantage for
               incorporating patient factors in the development of tiered
               reimbursement models. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Prognostic Level II.

               hospital mortality rates for different subgroups of patients.
               METHODS: One hundred and seventy-four patients were included in
               this analysis over a oneyear period in the MICU, Clinical
               Center, University of Sarajevo. The following patient data were
               obtained: demographics, admission diagnosis, SAPS II, APACHE II
               scores and final outcome. RESULTS: Out of 174 patients, 70
               patients (40.2\%) died. Mean SAPS II and APACHE II scores in all
               patients were 48.4$\pm$17.0 and 21.6$\pm$10.3 respectively, and
               they were significantly different between survivors and
               non-survivors. SAPS II >50.5 and APACHE II >27.5 can predict the
               risk of mortality in these patients. There was no statistically
               significant difference in the clinical values of SAPS II vs
               APACHE II (p=0.501). A statistically significant positive
               correlation was established between the values of SAPS II and
               APACHE II (r=0.708; p=0.001). Patients with an admission

               had an excellent ability to discriminate between survivors and
               non-survivors. There was no significant difference in the
               clinical values of SAPS II and APACHE II. A positive correlation

  abstract  = "OBJECTIVE: Trauma is a leading cause of mortality and morbidity
               globally, disproportionately affecting low/middle-income
               countries (LMICs). Understanding the factors determining
               implementation success for in-hospital Trauma Quality
               Improvement Programs (TQIPs) is critical to reducing the global
               trauma burden. We synthesised topical literature to identify key
               facilitators and barriers to in-hospital TQIP implementation
               across country income levels. DESIGN: Scoping review. DATA
               SOURCES: PubMed, Web of Science and Global Index Medicus
               databases were searched from June 2009 to January 2022.
               ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA: Published literature involving any study
               design, written in English and evaluating any implemented
               in-hospital quality improvement programme in trauma populations
               worldwide. Literature that was non-English, unpublished and
               involved non-hospital TQIPs was excluded. DATA EXTRACTION AND
               SYNTHESIS: Two reviewers completed a three-stage screening
               process using Covidence, with any discrepancies resolved through
               a third reviewer. Content analysis using the Consolidated
               Framework for Implementation Research identified facilitator and
               barrier themes for in-hospital TQIP implementation. RESULTS:
               Twenty-eight studies met the eligibility criteria from 3923
               studies identified. The most discussed in-hospital TQIPs in
               included literature were trauma registries. Facilitators and
               barriers were similar across all country income levels. The main
               facilitator themes identified were the prioritisation of staff
               education and training, strengthening stakeholder dialogue and
               providing standardised best-practice guidelines. The key barrier
               theme identified in LMICs was poor data quality, while
               high-income countries (HICs) had reduced communication across
               professional hierarchies. CONCLUSIONS: Stakeholder
               prioritisation of in-hospital TQIPs, along with increased
               knowledge and consensus of trauma care best practices, are
               essential efforts to reduce the global trauma burden. The
               primary focus of future studies on in-hospital TQIPs in LMICs
               should target improving registry data quality, while
               interventions in HICs should target strengthening communication
               channels between healthcare professionals.",

               SELECTION: A PubMed literature review was performed for relevant
               articles in English related to the management of adult humans
               with severe trauma. Specific topics included airway management,
               hemorrhagic shock, resuscitation, and specific injuries to the
               chest, abdomen, brain, and spinal cord. DATA EXTRACTION AND DATA
               SYNTHESIS: The basic principles of initial management of the
               critically ill trauma patients include rapid identification and
               management of life-threatening injuries with the goal of
               restoring tissue oxygenation and controlling hemorrhage as
               rapidly as possible. The initial assessment of the patient is
               often truncated for procedures to manage life-threatening
               injuries. Major, open surgical procedures have often been
               replaced by nonoperative or less-invasive approaches, even for
               critically ill patients. Consequently, much of the early
               management has been shifted to the ICU, where the goal is to
               continue resuscitation to restore homeostasis while completing
               the initial assessment of the patient and watching closely for
               failure of nonoperative management, complications of procedures,
               and missed injuries. CONCLUSIONS: The initial management of
               critically ill trauma patients is complex. Multiple, sometimes
               competing, priorities need to be considered. Close collaboration

               patients, treated by 1448 physicians, in the study, of whom
               40.6\% were treated at an academic center. We found no
               significant difference in the primary outcome (death,
               readmission, or complication) between patients who underwent a
               daytime procedure performed by a physician who had provided
               patient care after midnight and those who underwent a procedure
               performed by a physician who had not treated patients after
               midnight (22.2\% and 22.4\%, respectively; P=0.66; adjusted odds
               ratio, 0.99; 95\% confidence interval, 0.95 to 1.03). We also
               found no significant difference in outcomes after stratification
               for academic versus nonacademic center, physician's age, or type
               of procedure. Secondary analyses revealed no significant
               difference between patient groups in length of stay or procedure
               duration. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, the risks of adverse outcomes of
               elective daytime procedures were similar whether or not the
               physician had provided medical services the previous night.

               PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, Cochrane Library for studies
               published until June 2017. Study Selection: Included studies:
               randomized controlled trials or any kind of nonrandomized
               intervention studies, made reference to a ventilator bundle
               approach, assessed mortality in ICU-ventilated adult patients.
               Data Extraction: Items extracted: study characteristics,
               description of the bundle approach, number of patients in the
               comparison groups, hospital/ICU mortality, ventilator-associated
               pneumonia--related mortality, assessment of compliance to
               ventilator bundle and its score. Data Synthesis: Thirteen
               articles were included. The implementation of a ventilator
               bundle significantly reduced mortality (odds ratio, 0.90; 95\%
               CI, 0.84--0.97), with a stronger effect with a restriction to
               studies that reported mortality in ventilator-associated
               pneumonia patients (odds ratio, 0.71; 95\% CI, 0.52--0.97), to
               studies that provided active educational activities was analyzed
               (odds ratio, 0.88; 95\% CI, 0.78--0.99), and when the role of
               care procedures within the bundle (odds ratio, 0.87; 95\% CI,
               0.77--0.99). No survival benefit was associated with compliance
               to ventilator bundles. However, these results may have been
               confounded by the differential implementation of evidence-based
               procedures at baseline, which showed improved survival in the
               study subgroup that did not report implementation of these
               procedures at baseline (odds ratio, 0.82; 95\% CI, 0.70--0.96).
               Conclusions: Simple interventions in common clinical practice
               applied in a coordinated way as a part of a bundle care are
               effective in reducing mortality in ventilated ICU patients. More

              purpose of this study was to evaluate outcomes in adult trauma
              patients requiring VV ECMO. METHODS: Data were collected on adult
              trauma patients admitted between January 1, 2015, and November 1,
              2016. Demographics, injury-specific data, ECMO data, and survival
              to discharge were recorded. Medians [interquartile range (IQR)]
              were reported. A p value $\leq$0.05 was considered statistically
              significant. RESULTS: Eighteen patients required VV ECMO during
              the study period. Median age was 28.5 years (IQR 24-43). Median
              injury severity score (ISS) was 27 (IQR 21-41); median PaO2/FiO2
              (P/F) prior to ECMO cannulation was 61 (IQR 50-70). Median time
              from injury to cannulation was 3 (IQR 0-6) days. Median duration
              of ECMO was 266 (IQR 177-379) hours. Survival to discharge was
              78\%. Survivors had a significantly higher ISS (p = 0.03), longer
              intensive care unit length of stay (ICU LOS) (p < 0.0004),
              hospital LOS (p < 0.000004), and time on the ventilator (p <
              0.0003). Median time of injury to cannulation was significantly
              longer in patients who survived to discharge (p = 0.01). There
              was no difference in P/F ratio prior to cannulation (p = ns).

              requiring VV ECMO following injury compared to historical data.
              Although shorter time from injury to cannulation for VV ECMO was
              associated with death, select patients who meet criteria for VV

               in patients in nontraumatic shock but has not been investigated
               adequately as a tool to identify trauma patients at risk of
               dying. Our objective was to determine if trauma patients with
               impaired lactate clearance have a higher 24-hour mortality rate
               than patients whose lactate concentration normalizes. METHODS: A
               retrospective chart review identified patients who were admitted
               directly from the scene of injury to an urban trauma center
               between 2010 and 2013 and who had at least one lactate
               concentration measurement within 24 hours. Transfers, patients
               without lactate measurement, and those who were dead on arrival
               were excluded. Of the 26,545 screened patients, 18,304
               constituted the initial lactate measurement population, and
               3,887 were the lactate clearance cohorts. RESULTS: Initial
               lactate had an area under the receiver operating characteristic
               curve of 0.86 and 0.73 for mortality at 24 hours and in the
               hospital, respectively. An initial concentration of 3 mmol/L or
               greater had a sensitivity of 0.86 and a specificity of 0.73 for
               mortality at 24 hours. The mortality rate among patients with
               elevated lactate concentrations (n = 2,381; 5.6 [2.8] mmol/L)
               that did not decline to less than 2.0 mmol/L in response to
               resuscitative efforts (mean [SD] second measurement, 3.7 [1.9]
               mmol/L) was nearly seven times higher (4.1\% vs. 0.6\%, p <
               0.001) than among those with an elevated concentration (n =
               1,506, 5.3 [2.7] mmol/L) that normalized (1.4 [0.4] mmol/L).
               Logistic regression analysis showed that failure to clear
               lactate was associated with death more than any other feature
               (odds ratio, 7.4; 95\% confidence interval, 1.5-35.5), except
               having an Injury Severity Score (ISS) greater than 25 (odds
               ratio, 8.2; 95\% confidence interval, 2.7-25.2). CONCLUSION:
               Failure to clear lactate is a strong negative prognostic marker
               after injury. An initial lactate measurement combined with a
               second measurement for high-risk individuals might constitute a
               useful method of risk stratifying injured patients. LEVEL OF

               trauma patients requiring Intensive Care Unit (ICU) admission.
               METHODS: This retrospective study was conducted in the ICU of
               our institution in Greece during a six-year period (2010-215).
               RESULTS: Among 326 patients, trauma was caused by road traffic
               accidents in .5\%, followed by falls (21.1\%) and violence
               (7.4\%). Thirty-day mortality was 27.3\%. Multivariate analysis
               showed that higher New Injury Severity Score (NISS), severe
               head/neck injury, acute kidney injury, septic shock and
               hemorrhagic shock were significantly associated with mortality
               while higher Revised Injury Severity Classification, version II
               (RISC II) and the administration of enteral nutrition were
               associated with survival. NISS showed the higher accuracy in
               predicting 30-day mortality followed by RISC II, while scores
               based only in physiological variables had lower predictive
               ability. CONCLUSIONS: Increased mortality was strongly
               associated with the severity of the injury upon admission.
               Traumatic brain injury, septic shock and acute kidney injury
               have also been found among the strongest predictors of
               mortality. NISS can be considered as a statistically superior

               preventable deaths identified at an urban, level-1 trauma center
               (January 2002 to December 2010) were abstracted from the trauma
               registry. Errors deemed avoidable were classified within the

  abstract  = "BACKGROUND: Traumatic injury is a leading cause of morbidity and
               mortality worldwide, but epidemiologic data about trauma
               patients who require intensive care unit (ICU) admission are
               scant. This study aimed to describe the annual incidence of ICU
               admission for adult trauma patients, including an assessment of
               risk factors for hospital complications and mortality in this
               population. METHODS: This was a retrospective study of adults
               hospitalized at Level 1 and Level 2 trauma centers after trauma
               and recorded in the National Trauma Data Bank in 2013. Multiple
               logistic regression analyses were performed to determine
               predictors of hospital complications and hospital mortality for
               those who required ICU admission. RESULTS: There were an
               estimated total of 1.03 million ICU admissions for trauma at
               Level 1 and Level 2 trauma centers in the United States in 2013,
               yielding an annual incidence of 3.3 per 1000 population. The
               annual incidence was highest in men (4.6 versus 1.9 per 100,000
               for women), those aged 80 years or older (7.8 versus 3.6-4.3 per
               100,000 in other age groups), and residents in the Western US
               Census region (3.9 versus 2.7 to 3.6 per 100,000 in other
               regions). The most common complications in patients admitted to
               the ICU were pneumonia (10.9 \%), urinary tract infection (4.7
               \%), and acute respiratory distress syndrome (4.4 \%). Hospital
               mortality was significantly higher for ICU patients who
               developed one or more complications (16.9 \% versus 10.7 \% for
               those who did not develop any complications, p < 0.001).
               CONCLUSIONS: Admission to the ICU after traumatic injury is
               common, and almost a quarter of these patients experience
               hospital complications. Hospital complications are associated
               with significantly increased risk of mortality.",

  abstract  = "RATIONALE: The weaning process concerns all patients receiving
               mechanical ventilation. A previous classification into simple,
               prolonged, and difficult weaning ignored weaning failure and
               presupposed the use of spontaneous breathing trials. OBJECTIVES:
               To describe the weaning process, defined as starting with any
               attempt at separation from mechanical ventilation and its
               prognosis, according to a new operational classification working
               for all patients under ventilation. METHODS: This was a
               multinational prospective multicenter observational study over 3
               months of all patients receiving mechanical ventilation in 36
               intensive care units, with daily collection of ventilation and
               weaning modalities. Pragmatic definitions of separation attempt
               and weaning success allowed us to allocate patients in four
               groups. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: A total of 2,729 patients
               were enrolled. Although half of them could not be classified
               using the previous definition, 99\% entered the groups on the
               basis of our new definition as follows: 24\% never started a
               weaning process, 57\% had a weaning process of less than 24
               hours (group 1), 10\% had a difficult weaning of more than 1 day
               and less than 1 week (group 2), and 9\% had a prolonged weaning
               duration of 1 week or more (group 3). Duration of ventilation,
               intensive care unit stay, and mortality (6, 17, and 29\% for the
               three groups, respectively) all significantly increased from one
               group to the next. The unadjusted risk of dying was 19\% after
               the first separation attempt and increased to 37\% after 10
               days. CONCLUSIONS: A new classification allows us to categorize
               all weaning situations. Every additional day without a weaning
               success after the first separation attempt increases the risk of
               dying.",

               failure are factors associated with prolonged hospital length of
               stay and increased morbidity and mortality. In addition to the
               burden these places on patients and their families, it also
               imposes high costs on the public health system. The aim of this
               systematic review was to identify risk factors for PMV and
               weaning failure. METHODS: The study was conducted according to
               PRISMA guidelines. After a comprehensive search of the COCHRANE
               Library, CINHAL, Web of Science, MEDLINE, and the LILACS
               Database a PubMed request was made on June 8, 2020. Studies that
               examined risk factors for PMV, defined as mechanical ventilation
               $\geq$96 h, weaning failure, and prolonged weaning in German and
               English were considered eligible; reviews, meta-analyses, and
               studies in very specific patient populations whose results are
               not necessarily applicable to the majority of ICU patients as
               well as pediatric studies were excluded from the analysis. This
               systematic review was registered in the PROSPERO register under
               the number CRD42021271038. RESULTS: Of 532 articles identified,
               23 studies with a total of 23,418 patients met the inclusion
               criteria. Fourteen studies investigated risk factors of PMV
               including prolonged weaning, 9 studies analyzed risk factors of
               weaning failure. The concrete definitions of these outcomes
               varied considerably between studies. For PMV, a variety of risk
               factors were identified, including comorbidities, site of
               intubation, various laboratory or blood gas parameters,
               ventilator settings, functional parameters, and critical care
               scoring systems. The risk of weaning failure was mainly related
               to age, previous home mechanical ventilation (HMV), cause of
               ventilation, and preexisting underlying diseases. Elevated PaCO2
               values during spontaneous breathing trials were indicative of
               prolonged weaning and weaning failure. CONCLUSION: A direct
               comparison of risk factors was not possible because of the
               heterogeneity of the studies. The large number of different
               definitions and relevant parameters reflects the heterogeneity
               of patients undergoing PMV and those discharged to HMV after
               unsuccessful weaning. Multidimensional scores are more likely to
               reflect the full spectrum of patients ventilated in different
               ICUs than single risk factors.",

               preventable and potentially preventable deaths occurring at a
               mature Level I trauma center. METHODS: All trauma patients that
               died during their initial hospital admission during an 8-year
               period (January, 1998 to December, 2005) were analyzed. The
               deaths were initially reviewed at a weekly Morbidity and
               Mortality (M\&M) conference followed by a multidisciplinary
               (Trauma Surgery, Critical Care, Emergency Medicine,
               Neurosurgery, Nursing, and Coroner) Combined Trauma Death Review
               Committee, and were classified into nonpreventable, potentially
               preventable, and preventable deaths. All preventable and
               potentially preventable deaths were identified for the purpose
               of the study. Quality improvement death forms included data on
               epidemiology, vital signs, injury severity, type of injury,
               probability of survival with Trauma and Injury Severity Score
               methodology, preventability (nonpreventable, potentially
               preventable, and preventable deaths), errors in the evaluation
               and management of the patient, and classification of errors
               (system, judgment, knowledge). Additional injury details,
               clinical course, circumstances leading to the death and autopsy
               findings were abstracted from the trauma registry and individual
               chart review. RESULTS: During the study period, 35,311 patients
               meeting trauma registry criteria were admitted and a total of
               2,081 (5.9\%) deaths occurred. Fifty-one deaths were classified
               as preventable or potentially preventable deaths (0.1\% of
               admissions, 2.5\% of deaths). Eleven of them (0.53\% of deaths)
               were classified as preventable and 40 (1.92\% of deaths) as
               potentially preventable deaths. Mean age was 40 years, 66.7\%
               were men, mean Injury Severity Score was 27, 74.5\% were blunt.
               The most common cause of death was bleeding (20, 39.2\%)
               followed by multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (14, 27.5\%) and
               cardiorespiratory arrest (8, 15.6\%). This was caused by a delay
               in treatment (27, 52.9\%), clinical judgment error (11, 21.6\%),
               missed diagnosis (6, 11.8\%), technical error (4, 7.8\%), and
               other (3, 5.9\%). The deaths peaked at two time periods: 26
               (51.1\%) during the first 24 hours and 16 (31.4\%) after 7 days.
               Only one patient (2.0\%) died in the first hour. The most common
               location of death was the intensive care unit (28, 54.9\%),
               operating room (13, 25.5\%), and emergency room (5, 9.8\%).
               CONCLUSION: Preventable or potentially preventable deaths are
               rare but do occur at an academic Level I trauma center. Delay in

               after injury. This retrospective study aimed to characterize
               opportunities for performance improvement (OPIs) identified in
               patients who died from bleeding and were considered by the
               quality improvement system of a major trauma centre. METHODS:
               All trauma deaths in 2006-2010 were discussed at the trauma
               morbidity and mortality meeting. Deaths from haemorrhage were
               identified and subjected to qualitative and quantitative
               evaluation. OPIs were identified and remedial action was taken.
               RESULTS: During the study interval there were 7511 trauma team
               activations; 423 patients died. Haemorrhage was the second most
               common cause of death, in 112 patients, and made a substantial
               contribution to death in a further 15. For 84 of these 127
               patients, a total of 150 OPIs were identified. Most arose in the
               emergency department, but involved personnel from many
               departments. Problems with decision-making were more common than
               errors in technical skill. OPIs frequently involved the decision
               between surgery, radiology and further investigation. Delayed
               and inappropriate surgery occurred even when investigation and
               diagnosis were appropriate. The mortality rate among patients
               presenting in shock fell significantly over the study interval
               (P < 0·026). CONCLUSION: Problems with judgement are more common
               than those of skill. Death from traumatic haemorrhage is
               associated with identifiable, remediable failures in care. The
               implementation of a systematic trauma quality improvement system
               was associated with a fall in the mortality rate among patients
